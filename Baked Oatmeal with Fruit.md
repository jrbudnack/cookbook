# Baked Oatmeal with Fruit

INGREDIENTS:
- 2 cups oats
- 1 ½ cup milk
- 2 eggs 
- ¼ cup maple syrup 
- 1 tsp vanilla
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- 1 ½ tsp. baking powder
- 2 cups Fruit (mixed berries, strawberries, mangoes, chopped apples, raisins, etc)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix all the ingredients, aside from the fruit, together. Fold in the fruit and pour into a lightly greased pan. Bake until the center is set—usually around 25 minutes. Enjoy right out of the oven or prep the night before for an easy breakfast!

- Note: if you use frozen berries cooking time will be approx 20 min longer than fresh.
