## Ingredients
-   ¼ cup butter or margarine
-   4 (8 ounce) russet potatoes, quartered and sliced

-   2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives

## Directions
-  Melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes and spread out in an even layer. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Season with garlic, paprika, salt and pepper; stir to coat potatoes evenly.
