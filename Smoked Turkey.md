        * OR - 30 min. of thawing time per 1 lb in cold water, changing water every 30 min.
    
    * 30 min. of smoking time for every 1 lb of turkey + add 1 hour from time put into smoker
    * Keep smoker at 225F as much as possible.

    * ¼ cup dark brown sugar
    * 1 Tablespoon coarse sea salt
    * 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper
    * 2 teaspoons smoked paprika ((hot or mild, whichever you prefer))
    * 2 teaspoons garlic powder
    * 2 teaspoons onion powder
    * 1 teaspoon ground mustard
    * ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

* With 13 lb turkey
    * Thaw turkey 4.5 days in advance (so Saturday afternoon before Thanksgiving, for example)
    * Prep
        * Remove butt and gibblets, and plastic ring - throw away
        * Rinse thoroughly, getting rid of any remaining ice crystals. 
        * Pat outside and inside with paper towels before rubbing
        * Melt 1/2 - to 3/4 stick of butter or margerine, brush onto skin
        * Put rub into glass shaker, shake rub all over turkey.  Shake into gloved hand and pat onto sides and bottom to coat
    
    * Allow 8 hours between when you start the smoker to when you want the turkey to be done
        * Gives you 1/2 hour prep time before putting turkey into smoker
        * Gives 1/2 hour to 1 hour buffer in case turkey takes longer to reach temperature

* Put thermometer probes in both turkey breasts, use lowest temperature to determine "done"
* After pulling turkey from smoker, Cover with foil for 15-30 min. and let rest on the counter
    * Might want to try a longer rest if there's time.
    * Try carving closer to serving time
    * Warming drawer on oven set on High works quite well to keep turkey warm before serving
