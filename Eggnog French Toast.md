URL:  https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/egg-nog-french-toast/

## Ingredients
-   8 thick slices bread , we like sara lee artesana or brioche
-   4 large eggs , room temperature
-   2/3 cup eggnog
-   1 Tablespoon light brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions
-   Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or heat a skillet over medium heat.  
-   Add all ingredients, except the bread, to a blender or to a shallow dish and whisk well to combine. If whisking by hand, it's okay if the flour doesn't mix in completely smooth.
-   Grease skillet with butter or non-stick spray. Dip the bread in the batter and turn to generously coat both sides.
-   Place on hot skillet and cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the bread starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same.
