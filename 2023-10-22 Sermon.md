# 2023-10-22 Sermon

Nehemiah 13
- Theme: Upkeep for our soul
  - We have to keep watch over the little things 
- God kept His promise to curse those who curse Israel (the Ammonites and the Moabites), so they are not to enter the Assembly of God
  - Nehemiah came back after 20 years to see an Ammonite living in the temple and the storeroom empty
- Give just a little bit to sin and before you know it it takes over
-
