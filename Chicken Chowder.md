# Chicken Chowder

by:  Kathie Budnack

## Ingredients
- Cut up whole chicken or chicken parts
- 3 qt chicken broth (use about 2.5, depending on volume)
- 1/2 bag frozen corn
- 6-8 fresh carrots
- 16oz bag Navy Beans
- 6-8 fresh potatoes
- Celery (optional) (2-3 stalks)
- Onion or onion flakes (for flavoring) (1 tbsp?)
- JRB - add 1 tbsp minced garlic
- Chicken flavoring (comes in a jar, usually found in store by spices)
- 1/2 bag frozen peas
- 1/2 bag frozen green beans

## Instructions:
Start preparation the night before you plan to serve it. Use a large crockpot. Cook (boil) a whole chicken or chicken parts for 90min. Remove skin and bones and cut up the meat into small pieces and add to the pot. Add the chicken broth.

Boil the navy beans with 3 cups of water for 2 minutes. Let set for an hour and add to cpot. 

Peel the carrots and cut into small chunks. Cut the celery into small pieces. Peal and cube the potatoes. Add these to the pot. 

Add a little chopped onion or onion flakes for flavoring. 

Cook on high for 1 hour, then switch to low. Stir occasionally to insure everything is mixed well.

In the morning add 1-2 tablespoons of chicken flavoring to the pot.

Add 1/2 bag frozen peas 1 hour before serving. (If you add them much earlier they will turn black)
