# Fathead Dough

From Matt Tomasov

**Ingredients**

4 cups shredded mozzarella

3 tbsp coconut flour (or possibly use all almond flour instead)

4 tbsp almond flour

1 egg

1 tsp Italian Seasoning

Microwave 2 cups shredded mozzarella about a minute, mix, and continue at 30 seconds more until soft and gooey. Mix in 3 tbsp coconut flour and 4 tbsp almond flour, and 1 tsp italian seasoning.  Microwave again at 30 second internals and mix in between. Should be 2-3 times. Then mix in the egg, after putting the egg in a bowl before and whipping it up. Then mix the egg into the mixture and put it on the silicone mat and keep flattening and folding it until it is mixed in well.

Then just flatten it out on a pan with parchment paper or foil.  Put sauce, cheese, and toppings on it.

**White Pizza**

1 yellow onion

1 tbsp onion powder

1 tbsp garlic powder

1 tomato

Mix about 3 tbsp butter with maybe a tbsp garlic powder and half a tbsp onion powder. Heat the butter until melted and just mix it up. Then spread it out on the flattened dough evenly.

Put about half a yellow onion sliced somewhat thin on top of that.  Then, cover it with mozzarella cheese.  After that, put thin slices of tomato on top.

Bake for 15-30 minutes at 350. Just watch it until the cheese is nice and melted.  Should be about 20 minutes.

The dough isn't as solid as you might think so right out of the oven you probably can't hold it like regular pizza.

It needs to cool a bit for that but I just ate it with a knife and fork.
