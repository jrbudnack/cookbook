# Eggnog
URL:  https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/homemade-eggnog/

## Ingredients
-   6 large egg yolks
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   1 cup heavy whipping cream
-   2 cups milk
-   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   pinch of salt (forgot last time, it turned out fine)
-   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   ground cinnamon , for topping
-   alcohol optional, see note

## Instructions
-   Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until light and creamy.
-   In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk, nutmeg and salt. Stir often until mixture reaches a bare simmer. 
-   Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs. 
-   Once most of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on the stove. 
-   Whisk constantly for just a few minutes, until the mixture is just slightly thickened (or until it reaches about 160 degrees F on a thermometer). It will thicken more as it cools.
-   Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, and alcohol*, if using.
-   Pour the eggnog through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or other container and cover with plastic wrap. 
-   Refrigerate until chilled. It will thicken as it cools. If you want a thinner, completely smooth consistency, you can add the entire mixture to a blender with 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk and blend until smooth.
-   Serve with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg, and fresh whipped cream, if desired.
-   Store homemade eggnog in the fridge for up to one week.
