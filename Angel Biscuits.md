## Ingredients
- 1 package regular or quick active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 2 tablespoons warm water (105° to 115°)
- 2 1/2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup shortening
- About 1 cup buttermilk

## Instructions
- Heat oven to 400°. Dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside.
- Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender or crisscrossing 2 knives, until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in yeast mixture and just enough buttermilk so dough leaves side of bowl and forms a ball.
- Place dough on generously floured surface; gently roll in flour to coat. Knead lightly 25 to 30 times, sprinkling with flour if dough is too sticky. Roll or pat 1/2 inch thick. Cut with floured 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Place about 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet.
- Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Brush with butter. Serve hot.
