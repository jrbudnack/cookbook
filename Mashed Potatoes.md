# Mashed Potatoes

4lbs White Potatoes

1.45 tbsp kosher salt

6 cloves of garlic, pressed (if adding garlic)

Milk, to consistency (or almond milk, if non-dairy)

9 tbsp butter (or Imperial Margarine, if non-dairy)

1.45 tbsp parsley

Cube and cook potatoes until tender / mashable (can easily pierce with fork, almost fall apart).  Drain, then mash potatoes.  Add cut-up butter or margarine, parsley, salt, and pressed garlic.  Mix with mixer, adding milk to consistency
