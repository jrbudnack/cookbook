# Crockpot Macaroni & Cheese

- 1 pound uncooked elbow macaroni
- kosher salt
- cooking spray
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
- 3 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; add macaroni and 4 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook pasta until just barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.

Spray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add pasta to the slow cooker and stir in milk, evaporated milk, butter, cream cheese and pepper. Whisk together egg and egg yolk in a small bowl until well combined; stir into pasta mixture. Set aside 3/4 cup shredded cheese. Stir remaining cheese into pasta mixture, cover, and cook on Low until bubbly and lightly browned around the edges, about 1 1/2 hours. 

Sprinkle with reserved cheese, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes more. Serve immediately. Alternatively, turn crockpot to Warm or Off until ready to serve.
