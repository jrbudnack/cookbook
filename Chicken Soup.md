# Chicken Soup (by Kathie Budnack)

Instructions* Bring cleaned whole fryer chicken (2lbs or more), 4-5 bay leaves, salt to taste, to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and let simmer for one hour.
* Remove from heat, let chicken cool.
* Strain chicken broth and set aside (in refrigerator and skim fat off top when cool).
* When chicken is cool take off skin and de-bone meat. Cut up chicken.
* When ready to make soup, put chicken and broth in a pot, add fresh bay leaves, salt and pepper, cut up carrots and celery (celery is optional). Bring to boil then reduce heat and let simmer for about an hour. Add chicken soup base to taste (too much will make it salty, too little will make it taste watery) Start with two tablespoons and add from there. 20025 minutes Â before eating add a bag of egg noodles(12-16 oz) let simmer for 15 minutes, remove from heat and put in bowls. Let cool.
* If you have leftover chicken from another meal, cut up and use just use three cans of chicken broth adding enough water to the pot to about two inches from top of pot. Make the same as other recipe otherwise.
