# Tuna Croquettes (by Steve & Rachel Budnack)

Ingredients* 1 6-oz can albacore tuna in water, drained
* 3/4 cup Fiber One original cereal
* 1/2 cup Eggbeaters
* 2 green onions
* 2 tsp dijonnaise
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 1/2 tsp salt
* additional salt, pepper, onion powder and any other seasonings you like

Instructions

* Place fiber One in blender along with any seasonings you like such as black pepper, onion powder, salt, etc. Grind to breadcrumb consistency. Place half of crumbs in dish and other half in mixing bowl. 
* Shred tuna and add to crumbs in mixing bowl along with other ingredients. Stir until mixed. 
* Line baking sheet with wax paper and form tuna into 8 mounds on paper. Let it sit at room temp for 15 minutes.. 
* Coat the mounds in the dish of Fiber One crumbs and cook in skillet heated over medium heat and coated with olive oil spray. Cook for about 3 minutes and flip. I cooked mine on a griddle so I could do them all at once.

* (Rachel's Notes:  I'm copying the original recipe, but the one I used was a version someone else made after changing a few things around with the original...and by the time I finished, I had added my own changes.  For example, the original calls for egg beaters, the second called for egg whites, and I just threw in a whole egg (well, minus the shell of course).  The ratio is about 1 egg per can of tuna.  I didn't have green onions, so I minced a white onion instead (which we loved), I also skipped the lemon juice, and made my own dijonaise cutting down on the mayo for health and cutting down on the mustard since Steve doesn't especially care for it.  Instead of Fiber One, I used whatever fiber-rich bran cereals we had. )
