by: Rodney Budnack

## Ingredients
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margarine, softened
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups chocolate chips
* 1 cup chopped nuts (optional) 

## Instructions
* Preheat oven to 350.
* Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl.  Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl until creamy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually beat in flour mixture.  Stir in morsels and nuts.  Drop by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets.  Bake for 9 minutes, then broil for 2 minutes. 
* Note:  When using Splenda instead of granulated sugar, the cookies don't spread as well.  Smush 'em!
