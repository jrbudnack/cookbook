Adapted from (http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1958,133187-241194,00.html)

Ingredients* 8 oz manicotti shells, uncooked 
* 8 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded 
* 15 oz ricotta cheese, drained 
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese OR 1/4 cup Wegmans Italian Blend (Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano) 
* 2 tbsp chopped parsley 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/4 tsp pepper 
* 32 oz spaghetti sauce (1 jar)
Instructions

* Drain ricotta by wrapping in 2 layers of cheesecloth, place in collander over a pan, with cans on top of wrapped cheese to weigh it down.  Place in refrigerator for 1 hour.  There may not be any drippings in the pan, but the cheesecloth may absorb much of the moisture. 
* Cook manicotti according to package directions; drain.  (Cool in single layer on wax paper or aluminum foil to prevent manicotti from sticking together).  Combine cheeses, parsley, salt and pepper for filling; spoon into manicotti in single layer over sauce on bottom of 9x13 inch baking pan; arrange manicotti in single layer over sauce.  Cover with remaining sauce.  Cover with aluminum foil; bake at 350F for about 40 minutes. 
* Remove foil; bake 15 minutes longer.  6 to 8 servings.
