# Peanut Butter Oat Chocolate Chip Energy Balls

1 cup oats (I’ve used both quick oats and old-fashioned oats, but make sure to buy organic oats! We’re not a big “organic” family but this is actually one item that’d be wise to buy organic.)
1/3 cup honey
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup ground flaxseed
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips
1 cup sweetened coconut flakes (use sweetened because it seems to have a softer, easier texture to work with)
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
