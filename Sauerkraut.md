Source:  https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sauerkraut-with-gin-and-caraway

## Ingredients
* 2-pound bag sauerkraut, drained
* 1 1/2 cups London dry gin
* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
* 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) chilled unsalted butter, diced

## Instructions
Combine sauerkraut, gin, and caraway seeds in heavy large saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently,
uncovered, until gin is reduced by slightly more than half, stirring occasionally (sauerkraut will still be crunchy and gin and caraway flavors will
be absorbed), about 30 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted. Serve warm.
