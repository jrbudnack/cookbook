### Ingredients
-   4 - 6 (6 oz or 170 g) salmon fillets, skin removed
-   2 tablespoons minced garlic
-   2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
-   1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
-   Olive oil cooking spray
-   1 teaspoon Kosher salt (or sea salt flakes)
-   1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
-   4 bunches asparagus (24 spears), woody ends removed
-   1 lemon , sliced to garnish
-   1/3 cup beans/peas or any other greens

### Instructions
-   Preheat oven broiler (or grill) to high heat. Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil. Arrange oven shelf to the second top shelf (about 8-inches from the heat element).
-   Place the salmon on a large baking tray. Rub each fillet evenly with the garlic and parsley to evenly coat; pour over the lemon juice. Spray with a light coating of olive oil spray and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the asparagus and greens around the salmon in a single layer, and place the lemon slices over the top.
-   Broil (or grill) for 8-10 minutes, or until salmon is cooked through to your liking (we find 8 minutes is perfect if the oven is hot).
-   Serve with the asparagus and beans/peas and these [Crispy Smashed Potatoes](https://cafedelites.com/2016/03/19/crispy-garlic-butter-parmesan-smashed-potatoes/)!

### Ingredients
-   2 lbs | 1kg potatoes Yukon Gold or Carisma
-   A light spray of olive oil
-   3 tablespoons melted butter
-   4 cloves garlic , crushed
-   1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley
-   Kosher Salt and Black Pepper to taste
-   2 tablespoons Parmesan Cheese

### Instructions
-   Pre-heat your oven to broil (or grill) settings to medium-high heat (about 200°C | 400°F).   
-   Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to the boil; cook, covered for 30-35 minutes or until just fork-tender. Drain well.
-   Lightly grease a large baking sheet or tray with cooking oil spray. Arrange potatoes onto the sheet and use a potato masher to LIGHTLY flatten the potatoes in one piece (not too hard or they will end up mashed).
-   Mix together the butter, garlic and parsley. Pour the mixture over each potato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and lightly spray with olive oil spray.
-   Broil (or grill) until they are golden and crispy (about 10-15 minutes). Remove from oven, sprinkle over the parmesan cheese and return to the oven until the cheese is melted.
-   To serve, season with a little extra salt and parsley, and serve immediately.
