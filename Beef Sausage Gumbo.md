## Ingredients:
* 2 pounds beef Shank Cross-Cut
* 1 quart + 1/2 cup beef stock
* 1/2 cup canola oil
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup diced onion
* 1/2 cup diced celery
* 1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
* 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 package (12 ounces) smoked beef sausage, sliced
* 2 tablespoons Creole Seasoning (Creole Kick)

Serving Suggestion:
Hot cooked rice, sliced green onion, sliced pickled okra, sliced pickled jalapeño (optional)

## Instructions

### Brown the Beef
* Brown all sides of beef Shank Cross-Cut in 6-quart pressure cooker using sauté or browning setting, as desired. Add 1/2 cup stock to pressure cooker. Close and lock pressure cooker lid.
Use beef, stew or high-pressure setting on pressure cooker; program 40 minutes on pressure cooker timer.

Cook's Tip: You may brown beef Shank Cross-Cut in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat then add to pressure cooker. 

### Cook The Roux
* Meanwhile, heat oil in large heavy-bottom stock pot over medium-high heat until pot is almost smoking. Slowly whisk in flour until combined. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, whisking continuously until it turns a milk chocolate color.
Reduce heat to medium; slowly add onions as oil mixture may splatter. Cook 1 to 2 minutes until oil mixture turns dark chocolate color. Add celery, bell pepper, garlic and thyme; cook 4 to 6 until vegetables are soft. 
Add hot sauce, Worcestershire and tomato paste; cook 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining quart of stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, add sausage and Creole Seasoning; simmer 30 minutes.

Cook's Tip: Roux is an equal mixture of flour and fat used to thicken stews, sauces and gravies. It is the base for many gumbo recipes. In Cajun cooking, roux is cooked until it reaches a deep, rich brown color that adds flavor and color to the finished recipe.

### Put It Together
Use quick-release feature to release pressure; carefully remove lid. Remove beef from pressure cooker; discard cooking liquid. Shred beef into bite-sized pieces. Add beef to vegetable mixture; stir to combine.
Serve Gumbo with rice and green onion.
