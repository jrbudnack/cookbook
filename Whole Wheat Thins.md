# Whole Wheat Thins (by Rachel Budnack)

Ingredients* 3 cups whole wheat flour 
* 1/3 cup olive oil 
* 1 cup water 
* 1/2 tsp salt

Instructions

* Mix all ingredients.  You could add other spices and herbs.  Knead as little as possible to make a smooth dough.  Roll very thin on ungreased baking sheets.  Cut with pizza cutter to the size desired.  Prick each cracker a couple times with a fork.  Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes or until desired crispness.  You can remove the outside edges and return the baking sheet to the oven to let the center brown.

Other Notes

* (Rachel's Notes: I usually put in less than 1/3 cup of oil to cut down on the fat and add extra water to make up for the difference.  Sometimes I don't add any seasoning until after I roll the dough out, then I'll sprinkle it on top of the rolled out dough and roll over it just enough to press the seasonings slightly into the dough in order to bring the flavor from the seasonings out more.  If you use white flour let me know how it goes.  I haven't tried that.)
